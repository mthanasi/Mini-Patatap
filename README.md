## Game Model

On keypress, a circle is generated that animates itself away. A short audio clip plays with each keypress. Just press any key, A to Z, and turn up speakers!

## Cross Origin Error

If you want to get rid of the Cross Origin errors in the console, you'll need to run a local HTTP server from your project's directory and load the circles.html file from there. The steps are as follows:

* Unzip the js files
    1. Using python3 : python3 -m "http.server"
    2. Open up your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000
    3. Select the index.html file
